The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation

Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Variables:
subj_test <- test/subject_test.txt
x_test <- test/X_test.txt 
y_test <- test/y_test.txt 
subj_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
y_train <- test/y_train.txt 
features <- features.txt 
act_labels <- activity_labels.txt 


Merges train set and test set into one dataset
x is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject is created by merging subj_train and subj_test using rbind() function
mergedata is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
meanstd is created by subsetting MergeData, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Change labels dataset with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activity
All Acc in column’s name renamed into  Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name renamed into  Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name enamed into Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character t in column’s name enamed into Time
All start with character f in column’s name enamed into Frequency
